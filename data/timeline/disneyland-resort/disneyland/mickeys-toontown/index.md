Roger Rabbit was recognized as a lucrative character by Disney after the release of _Who Framed Roger Rabbit_, and a set of attractions based on the movie was developed for Disney theme parks. Roger Rabbit was set to be the star of his own land, behind Main Street, U.S.A. at Disneyland, called Hollywoodland. Meanwhile, at the Magic Kingdom, a new land behind Fantasyland was being developed in honor of Mickey Mouse's sixtieth birthday, aptly named Mickey's Birthdayland. There were also set to be attractions based on Roger Rabbit, Judge Doom, and Baby Herman opening in a major expansion at the Disney's Hollywood Studios and Tokyo Disneyland, but after the financial troubles of the Euro Disney Resort, plans were cut back.

Hollywoodland was combined with the concept of Mickey's Birthdayland, as well as a concept found in _Who Framed Roger Rabbit_, to form Mickey's Toontown, which opened in 1993 behind Fantasyland at Disneyland.

The buildings are stylized and colorful. There are several attractions involving classic cartoon characters, such as the houses of Mickey and Minnie Mouse, and a small children's coaster. There are a few interactive gags. Compared to other Disneyland areas however, there are few large or technically complex rides or shows, and the houses themselves appeal primarily as play areas for small children. On one of the windows above the library in this land, there is a reference to Laugh-O-Gram Studios, the studio that Disney created before the Disney Studios.

An early entry event called Toontown Morning Madness was held here for guests booking travel with the American Automobile Association (AAA) or book a vacation package with the Walt Disney Travel Company. However, _Morning Madness_ has been discontinued as of 2013 as Extra Magic Hour and Magic Morning are now offered. On nights that fireworks are scheduled, the land will close early for the day due to its proximity to the launch area for the fireworks. Mickey's Toontown Depot stays open from park opening to park closing as it also serves as a stop for Fantasyland with the station being next to the Fantasyland Theatre. On non-fireworks days, the land closes with the park.

In April 2019, Disney announced that Mickey & Minnie's Runaway Railway, now open at Disney's Hollywood Studios at Walt Disney World, would open at Mickey's Toontown in Disneyland in 2023. The ride will be housed in a new building within Toontown called the _El CapiTOON Theater_, a pun of the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood which in turn is owned by Disney. The attraction, which is expected to replace the Gag Factory store, will be the first new attraction added in Toontown since Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin opened in 1994.

On April 30, 2021, Disneyland Resort reopened after being temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic; however, most of the walkthrough attractions in Mickey's Toontown remain temporarily closed.

In November 2021, Disney announced that Mickey's Toontown in Disneyland will receive a makeover. The new features will include play experiences for children and families. With the addition of Mickey & Minnie’s Runaway Railway, a new children's play area will be added called CenTOONial Park and will feature a fountain. Mickey’s Toontown will close in March 2022 and is scheduled to reopened in early 2023.
