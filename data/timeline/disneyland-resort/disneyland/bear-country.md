Critter Country was originally named Indian Village. From 1956â€“1971, this section of Frontierland featured Native American shows and attractions, including the Indian War Canoes.The area was rebuilt as Disneyland's seventh themed land, Bear Country, which opened on March 4, 1972. The new four-acre land, Disneyland's first major expansion since the 1969 opening of The Haunted Mansion, cost $8 million to build. Located in the northwest quadrant of the park, Bear Country was themed to the forests of the Pacific Northwest. Country Bear Jamboree, which opened three weeks later, was the new land's centerpiece attraction.

Bear Country was also home to the Golden Bear Lodge, an eatery which was renamed Hungry Bear Restaurant in 1977, the Mile Long Bar refreshment center, Teddi Barra's Swingin' Arcade, and Davy Crockett's Explorer Canoes.
