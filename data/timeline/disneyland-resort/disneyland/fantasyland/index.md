Fantasyland is one of the original themed lands at Disneyland. Fantasyland features Sleeping Beauty Castle at its front, which is also the park's icon, and a central courtyard dominated by King Arthur Carrousel, in front of which sits a sword in an anvil; several times each day a costumed Merlin helps a child pull the sword from it. Walt Disney said, "What youngster has not dreamed of flying with Peter Pan over moonlit London, or tumbling into Alice's nonsensical Wonderland? In Fantasyland, these classic stories of everyone's youth have become realities for youngsters - of all ages - to participate in."

In 1983, Fantasyland received a major facelift (dubbed "New Fantasyland") and the attraction fa√ßades changed from a Renaissance motif to a fantasy mock up of a Bavarian village. Fantasyland's main entrance is through Sleeping Beauty Castle. The entrance also contains a separate walk-through attraction that opened in 1957 but was closed from 2001-2008 due to security concerns following the September 11, attacks. The attraction re-opened in May 2008.

The plaque in front of the castle marks the spot where the Disneyland Time Capsule is buried. Sealed on the 40th anniversary of the park (1995), it contains different items from the history of Disney parks. It is scheduled to be opened in the year 2035, forty years after it was first sealed. The famed "Fantasy in the Sky Fireworks" show was introduced in 1956, but Tinker Bell's first flight wasn't until 1961. The first Tinker Bell was Tiny Kline, former circus aerialist. Multiple shows have replaced this most involving some sort of 'flying' character, such as Tinker Bell.

Fantasyland was said, by Walt Disney, to be his favorite land in the park.
